	1- IOS upgrade
	2- register the GW to Kinetic cloud
	3- access EFF on cloud
	4- Get a RPi, using a switch to connect to GW;
	   the switch needs 2 VLANs, one to the GW, one to another (as receiver).
	   Use timestamp to get real-time data, see the performance;
 
	Have apps running on the GW - EFF as Edge & Fog processing;
	See weather this affects the receiving of data. Delay, jitter, etc.
