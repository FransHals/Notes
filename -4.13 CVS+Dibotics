# [Dibotics: From LiDAR to Smart LiDAR - raul.bravo@dibotics.com]
  Professional mobile robots.
  10 years ago, 2D LiDAR.
  Dibotics, LiDAR dominates the autonomous driving.
  To leverage LiDAR data. Much more powerful than what you can think. >cam, > RADAR

    1 - localisation: precise output -> a live 3D map -> REAL-TIME analysis -> no longer processing time!
        others are doing: anaylise frame per frame, the pic rather than the integrated signals/3D map.
                          LiDAR manufacturers ~ HW, users of LiDAR.
        - at point level rather than object level.
   
 ** instead of GPU/HD Cam, using a chip. no ML, no AI -> no fuss for complex algorithms!
 make the output richer.
    2 - (for CyberValet)
    calibration is nightmare.
    
    Security tracking -> difficult for cams(2D rahter than 3D) -> 3D LiDAR, 3D understanding
    
    //not selling product/IP, rather, smart LiDAR/ LiDAR in CPU/selling product or IP.

 CyberValet: Valeo Scala. A component implanted on the car.
